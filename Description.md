# Tower Climbing Game

## Project Overview

### Game Flow Enhancements

#### Battle Phase
The turn-based battle system includes defined actions such as Magic Attack, Strength Attack, Defend, and Heal.  
**Proposed Improvement:** Introduce status effects like poison and freeze to add strategic depth to combat.

#### Reward & Upgrade Phase
Players earn coins and upgrade stats between battles.  
**Proposed Improvement:** Implement a dynamic scaling system where higher levels offer greater rewards but also increase upgrade costs.

## Programming Development

### 3.1 Game Concept

The game follows a cycle:

1. **Battle Phase**:  
   Players engage in turn-based combat, choosing physical or magical attacks. Monsters retaliate with their own moves.

2. **Reward & Upgrade Phase**:  
   Players gain coins and level up. Between battles, they visit the shop to purchase upgrades for:
   - **Strength** (+1): Physical damage
   - **Magic** (+1): Magic damage
   - **Speed** (+0.1): Turn priority, dodge rate
   - **Health** (+50): Max HP

3. **Repeat**:  
   Players climb to the next tower level with improved stats.

### 3.3 Algorithms Involved

- **Turn-Based Battle Algorithm**:
  - Determines turn order using the speed stat.
  - Calculates damage using stats and random modifiers.
  - Ends battle when one character's HP reaches zero.

- **EXP and Coin Rewards**:
  - Rewards scale with enemy difficulty.
  - Leveling up increases base stats and may unlock new abilities.

- **Upgrade & Shop System**:
  - Shop sells potions, weapons, and magic tools.
  - Includes affordability checks.
  - Example items:
    - **Potion**: +25 HP
    - **Sword**: +10 Strength
    - **Wand**: +10 Magic

- **Event-Driven Input Processing**:
  - Inputs are managed through a validated event loop.
  - Ensures accurate and responsive gameplay transitions.
